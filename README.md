# Automatic-Watering-System
An Arduino-based automatic watering system for the plants at home. There are 2 water pumps connected to the plants, each connected to a particular group of them that have similar water needs. The motors are driven by relays as Arduino's digital pins cannot supply enough current for the motors to work properly. Hence Arduino controls the motors via the relays.
